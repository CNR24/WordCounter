Word Count API
You are developing an API for a text editing software. Your API should be able to count the
words, letters, and characters in a text. E.g., The text “Hello my name is Tom” has 5 words,
16 letters and 20 characters (spaces are characters but not letters). Your API routes are:
• “api/words” for counting words
• “api/letters” for counting letters
• “api/characters” for counting characters
Additional examples are listed below.
Project
You should implement a REST-based server in Java (use Spring Boot). The service should
be able to return the desired information using REST.
