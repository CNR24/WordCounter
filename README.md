Word Count API<br><br>
You are developing an API for a text editing software. Your API should be able to count the<br>
words, letters, and characters in a text. E.g., The text “Hello my name is Tom” has 5 words,<br>
16 letters and 20 characters (spaces are characters but not letters). Your API routes are:<br><br>
• “api/words” for counting words<br>
• “api/letters” for counting letters<br>
• “api/characters” for counting characters<br>
Additional examples are listed below.<br><br>
Project<br>
You should implement a REST-based server in Java (use Spring Boot). The service should
be able to return the desired information using REST.
